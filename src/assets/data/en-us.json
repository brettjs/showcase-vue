Utilizing mobile-first, responsive (or reactive) principles is the best way to guarantee beautiful layouts, at any size, and convey the appropriate amount of information while doing it.</p><p>I use sensible, semantic HTML5 and CSS3 as the basis for simple layouts. Interactivity is enabled with native JavaScript where performance is essential. If your needs are a bit more complex, though, don’t worry; I'm also well-versed in EmberJS (❤️), React, Angular, and assorted other libraries/frameworks as appropriate.</p>"
